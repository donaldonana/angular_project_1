The Second Continental Congress approved a new constitution, 
the "Articles of Confederation," for ratification by the states 
on November 15, 1777, and immediately began operating under 
their terms. The Articles were formally ratified on March 1, 
1781. At that point, the Continental Congress was dissolved and 
on the following day a new government of the United States in 
Congress Assembled took its place, with Samuel Huntington as 
presiding officer.[43][44]
